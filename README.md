### Problem:
* This repository contains source and data files for determining protein N-glycosylation with SVMs and fully connected neural networks. For each protein in [the dataset](data/UniProt cist/), physical and chemical attributes are created to be used in a learning process. Different techniques were used to overcome unbalanced data problem that is existent in the used data set.

### Running jupyter-notebook files:
* Every source file is adjusted for running inside Google Colaboratory environment.

### Data:
* Information on used data can be found in [Main\_1.ipynb](src/Main\_1.ipynb), as well as in [Master\_rad.pdf](Master\_rad.pdf).
* Instructions for creating input data for Machine Learning models can be found in Master\_rad.pdf.
* The most used Python libraries: Biopython, SciKit-Learn, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
